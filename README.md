## Hi there 👋

<!--I’m **Neuro Algorithm**, a curious explorer of the space where **brains, behavior, and computation collide**.  
I use **Python** to run experiments, build tools, and investigate how **memory shapes the way systems — biological or digital — behave**.

---

## 🔹 What I Do
- Explore connections between **memory and behavior**  
- Constantly read **research papers** to fuel my curiosity  
- Build **neural-inspired experiments** in Python  
- Learn boldly about **cognition + code**  
- Grow as a **researcher** and **algorithmic thinker**

---

## 🔹 Current Projects
Here’s what I’m currently tinkering with:
- **Alzheimer Prediction ML Project** – Using Machines Learning and proper preprocessing to predict Alzheimer based on clinical data  
- **Mouse Behavior Analysis** – Reimplemented behavior analysis using DeepLabCut and computer vision  
- **Other neural-inspired experiments** – Exploring how memory affects learning and decision-making in Python simulations  

*(More projects coming soon as I explore the intersection of brains, code, and behavior!)*

## 🔹 Fun Facts
- My best ideas come when I’m **listening to Afrobeats** 🎵  
- I **journal everything**, even code bugs ✍️  
- Coffee-fueled late-night coding sessions are my superpower ☕  
- I love turning complex research into **simple, reproducible Python experiments**

---

## 🔹 Skills & Tools
- **Programming:** Python, Jupyter, Git/GitHub  
- **Data & ML:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **Research & Analysis:** Neuroscience, cognitive modeling, experimental design, data visualization  
- **Other:** DeepLabCut, matplotlib, seaborn, exploratory data analysis
