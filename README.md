# Hi there 👋

I’m **Neuro Algorithm**, a curious explorer of the space where **brains, behavior, and computation collide**.  
I use **Python** to run experiments, build tools, and investigate how **memory shapes the way systems — biological or digital — behave**.   

---

## 🔹 What I Do
- Explore connections between memory and behavior 
- Constantly read research papers to fuel my curiosity  
- Build neural-inspired experiments in Python  
- Learn boldly about cognition + code
- Grow as a *researcher** and **algorithmic thinker**  

---

## 🔹 Current Projects
Here’s what I’m currently tinkering with:
- **Alzheimer Prediction ML Project** – Using Machine Learning and proper preprocessing to predict Alzheimer’s based on clinical data  
- **Mouse Behavior Analysis** – Reimplemented behavior analysis using DeepLabCut and computer vision  
- **Other neural-inspired experiments** – Exploring how memory affects learning and decision-making in Python simulations  

*(More projects coming soon as I explore the intersection of brains, code, and behavior!*
