# Neuro Algorithm

Hi! I'm a computational researcher who is learning about the messy intersection of neuroscience, behavior, and machine learning. I build data-driven experiments to understand how memory and cognition shape the way we (and machines) learn and make decisions.

When I'm not debugging Python or reading papers at 2am, I'm probably thinking about how brains encode the world—and how we can capture that in code.

## Research Interests

- **Computational Neuroscience**: How do memory systems actually work? What makes learning click?
- **Machine Learning in Healthcare**: Building models that predict disease and help real people
- **Computer Vision**: Teaching computers to watch behavior and understand what they're seeing

## Technical Skills

**Languages**: Python, R, SQL  
**ML/Data Science**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, pandas, NumPy  
**Computer Vision**: DeepLabCut, OpenCV  
**Tools**: Git, Jupyter

## Selected Projects

### 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Prediction
Built a machine learning pipeline to predict early-stage Alzheimer's from clinical data. Tackled the hard parts: class imbalance, missing values, and making models that actually generalize. Because healthcare ML should work in the real world, not just on clean datasets.  
**Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas

### 🐭 Automated Mouse Behavior Analysis
Reimplemented pose estimation to track mouse behavior frame-by-frame using DeepLabCut. Analyzed movement patterns to understand decision-making. Turns out mice are fascinating when you can quantify what they're doing.  
**Stack**: Python, DeepLabCut, OpenCV

### 🔬 Memory-Learning Simulations
Created computational experiments where artificial agents learn tasks while their "memory" gets tweaked. Exploring questions like: Does forgetting help learning? How does memory capacity change behavior?  
**Stack**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Current Focus

Right now I'm:
- Diving deeper into statistical modeling and Bayesian inference (because uncertainty is underrated)
- Reading everything I can about computational psychiatry and cognitive neuroscience
- Preparing applications for graduate programs where I can do this full-time

## Let's Connect

I love talking about neuroscience, ML, weird research ideas, or anything brain-adjacent. Open to collaborations, code reviews, paper recommendations, or just nerding out about science.

💡 **Fun fact**: I debug code best with Afrobeats in the background—something about the rhythm helps neural networks click
